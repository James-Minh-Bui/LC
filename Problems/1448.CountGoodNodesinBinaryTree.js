// Given a binary tree root, a node X in the tree is named good if in the path from root to X there are no nodes with a value greater than X.

// Return the number of good nodes in the binary tree.

 

// Example 1:



// Input: root = [3,1,4,3,null,1,5]
// Output: 4
// Explanation: Nodes in blue are good.
// Root Node (3) is always a good node.
// Node 4 -> (3,4) is the maximum value in the path starting from the root.
// Node 5 -> (3,4,5) is the maximum value in the path
// Node 3 -> (3,1,3) is the maximum value in the path.
// Example 2:



// Input: root = [3,3,null,4,2]
// Output: 3
// Explanation: Node 2 -> (3, 3, 2) is not good, because "3" is higher than it.
// Example 3:

// Input: root = [1]
// Output: 1
// Explanation: Root is considered as good.
